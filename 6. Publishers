"Node" is the ROS term for an executable that is connected to the ROS network. While a publisher is a ("talker") node which will continually broadcast a message. 
We create a new node in scripts as usual

*********************************************************PYTHON PUBLISHER******************************************************

$touch robot_news_rt.py
$chmod +X robot_news_rt.py (to make it executable)
vim robot_news_rt.py (to edit the file)

**********************************************************CODE

#!/usr/bin/env/python

import rospy

from std_msgs.msg import String % We import std_msgs to use the message string which contains a simple string data in it

if __name__ == '__main__':

rospy.init_node('robot_news_rt')

pub = rospy.Publisher("/robot_news_radio", String, queue_size=10) 

%We create a publisher with a name , a type and a queue size
%Here queue_size acts as a buffer to give time for the subscriber to receive the message

rate = rospy.Rate(2)

while not rospy.is_shutdown():

msg = String()

msg.data = "Hi, this is your favourite radio"

pub.publish(msg)

rate.sleep()

rospy.loginfo("Node was stopped")

******************************************************************

Now we will use a functionality called rostopic

$rostopic list

%Will display all the available topics

%In this case it will include robot_news_radio

$rostopic echo /robot_news_radio

%Will allow us to listen to this publisher

Output :

data: "Hi, this is your favourite radio"
