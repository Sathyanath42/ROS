****************************************************Turtle Sim

Install the required packages using

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlesim

$rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

This will give us the node of turtlesim which is of a turtle that can be controlled by laptop keys. Reading the laptop key input and then feeding it to the turtle.

This can be drawn out using rqt_graph commands to show the flow.

$rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Gives us control of the turtle using the keyboard keys

turtlesim and teleop_turtle are the names of the nodes

turtlesim_node, turtle_teleop_key are names of the executables

*************************************Publisher and subscriber example using Turtle_sim

Now we can see how publishers and subscribers work on the turtlesim

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node 
%to generate the turtle

$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key  
%to allow it to be controlled from the keyboard

$ rostopic info /turtle1/cmd_vel  
%will give you information about who is publishing to this topic and who is subscribing to it
%will show an output once you input into the keyboard arrow keys

Now using pub we can directly publish to this topic and have the turtle move without a keyboard arrow input

$ rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_ms/Twist "linear:       (on hitting tab after cmd_vel)
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0"
  
%Here we can individually change the value of each co ordinate and press enter to have the turtle move in that direction
