A ROS service is a client server/system, with the following features:
1. synchronous
2. for computations and quick actions like enabling an actuator
3. one message type for request and one message type for response
4. can be written in python or c++ directly inside ros nodes
5. a service server can only exist once but can have many clients

Note the difference from topics, which is a unidirectional data stream while here it is a client server relationship with to and fro communication.

Consider the following examples, a battery in a robot needs to communicate with the led panel on it. When the battery is low is a single led of the three should light up and so on.
Now here the request to light up the LED from the battery node (3rd led light up) would be sent to the ROS service (Set LED)
The service then sents this request to the LED node. When the LED has been successfully tunred on it returns the response to the service, which sends the message Success:True to the battery node.

**************************************************Creating a python service server*************************************************

We will create a service server that takes two numbers and returns the sum of the two.
When defining the name of the service its always best to start with a verb.

******************************************************CODE
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from rospy_tutorials.srv import AddTwoInts

def handle_addtwoints(req):
    result = req.a + req.b
    rospy.loginfo("sum of " + str(req.a) + " and " + str(req.b) + " is " + str(result))
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rospy.init_node("summer_server")
    rospy.loginfo("summer_server node created")

    service = rospy.Service("/add_two_ints", AddTwoInts, handle_addtwoints)
    rospy.loginfo("service server has been started")
    rospy.spin()                                      


Note how we define the service with a name and a function (AddTwoInts) as well as a return statemnet called handle_
AddTwoInts
