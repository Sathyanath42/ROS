************************************************8Publisher and subscriber

Radio analogy :

The mobile phone (subscriber) would be tuned in to the Freq (Topic) of the radio station (publisher) and both must have the type of signal (AM/FM) (same data structure).

Multiple subscribers can be tuned into multiple stations across the same freq and do not know of other subscribers but self.

Subscribers further do not know who is publishing the data. It's merely turned into that Freq

Similarly for publishers

Further a publisher can send data on an FM signal and an AM signal which can be received by different subscribers

Eg a car being a publisher is sending it's location values (Topic) which is subscribed to by a computer.

Topic : A named bus over which nodes exchange messages

The name must start with a letter.

When to use a topic ?

Unidirectional data stream (publisher to subscriber)

Both are anonymous

A topic has a message type

Can be written in py and C++ in a rosnode

The Rosmaster is contacted when a node wants to subscribe to a topic. (Rosmaster like a DNS server)
