*****************************************************Rosrun*********************************************************************
rosrun allows you to run an executable in an arbitrary package from anywhere without 
having to give its full path or cd/roscd there first.

Syntax:
rosrun <package> <executable>

Example:
We can use rosrun to directly execute the nodes as follows
$rosrun my_robot_tutorials node_cpp

$rosrun my_robot_tutorials my_first_node.py

$rosnode info nodename (info regarding the nodes)

$rosnode ping nodename(to check the ping on the nodes)


****************************************************Rqt graph

rqt_graph provides a GUI plugin for visualizing the ROS computation graph, allowing us to map out the nodes we have programmed.
Its components are made generic so that other packages where you want to achieve graph representation can depend upon this pkg.

We access the graph using

$rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
