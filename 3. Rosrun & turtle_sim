*****************************************************Rosrun*********************************************************************

We can use rosrun to directly execute the nodes as follows

$rosrun my_robot_tutorials node_cpp

$rosrun my_robot_tutorials my_first_node.py

$rosnode info nodename (info regarding the nodes)

$rosnode ping nodename(to check the ping on the nodes)


****************************************************Rqt graph

This is used to map out the nodes we have programmed

We access the graph using

$rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

****************************************************Turtle Sim

Install the required packages using

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlesim

$rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

This will give us the node of turtlesim which is of a turtle that can be controlled by laptop keys. Reading the laptop key input and then feeding it to the turtle.

This can be drawn out using rqt_graph commands to show the flow.

$rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Gives us control of the turtle using the keyboard keys

turtlesim and teleop_turtle are the names of the nodes

turtlesim_node, turtle_teleop_key are names of the executables
