A ROS service is a client server/system, with the following features:
1. synchronous
2. for computations and quick actions like enabling an actuator
3. one message type for request and one message type for response
4. can be written in python or c++ directly inside ros nodes
5. a service server can only exist once but can have many clients

Note the difference from topics, which is a unidirectional data stream while here it is a client server relationship with to and fro communication.
